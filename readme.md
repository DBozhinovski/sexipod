# How to contribute

1. Open an Issue and start a discussion -- what is it that you want to build / fix?
2. Develop the feature / fix the bug in a branch
3. When it's ready, create a pull request. Rebase! Automatic tests must pass, and the code must be reviewed before it's merged into `master`.

5. Dividends.
